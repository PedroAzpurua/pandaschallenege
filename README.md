Conclussions 
  More people seem to go to govenrment schools than independent schools.  
  The students of govenrment schools on average seem to have a lower passing of both units.

Attacehd are the activities for this week's cubmission working with Pandas to achieve a range of objectives. 

# Objective 1 --> Local Gov Summary
As seen in the data, there are 15 schools labeled as government or independent. Overall there were 39170 Students accross all schools The total budget was $24,649,428 The average math score overall was 70.34% THe average reading score overall was 69.98% 86% of students passed Maths 84.42% of students passed Reading 72.80% passed both
# Objective 2 --? School Summary
Key metrics have been displayed.
# Objective 3 --> Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
From here we foung that the top 5 schools were: Griffin Cabrera Bailey Wright Rodriguez
# Objective 4 --> Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
The bottom five schools were 
  Hernandez
  Huang
  Jhonson
  Wilson
  Ford
# Objective 5 --> Maths Scores by Year
Data was broken per school to determine the performance of math scores by year level
# Objective 6 --> Reading Scores by Year
Data was broken per school to determine the performance of READINGscores by year level
# Objective 6 --> Scores by School Spending
This was an interesting test, we found that schools with lower budgets per student outperformed some of their counterparts with higher spends
# Objective 7 --> Scores by School Size
The schoolswith the lowest amount of students seem to outperform the schools with much more students.
# Objective 9 --> Scores by School Type


Conclussions 
More people seem to go to govenrment schools than independent schools.  
The students of govenrment schools on average seem to have a lower passing of both units.
